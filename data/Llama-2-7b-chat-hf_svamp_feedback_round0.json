So, we can calculate the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by subtracting the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:\n\n186 (total t-shirts sold) - 172 (t-shirts sold during Arkansas game) = 14 (t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game)\n\nNext, to find out how much money was made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold during that game by the amount of money made per t-shirt:\n\n14 (t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game) x $78 (amount made per t-shirt) = $1092\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $1092, not $14."

However, since we already know that Marco picked 13 pounds of strawberries, and we want to find out how much more his dad picked, we subtract Marco's weight from his dad's weight: 35 pounds (total weight) minus 13 pounds (Marco's weight) equals 22 pounds (his dad's weight), but that's not what we're looking for. We want to know how much more his dad picked than Marco, so we need to find 22 pounds (his dad's weight) minus 13 pounds (Marco's weight), which equals 9 pounds.\n\nSo, the student's answer should be 9 pounds, not 22 pounds."

However, this method is incorrect because the 8 represents the difference in the number of crackers, not the number Matthew gave to each friend.\n\nTo find the number of crackers given to each friend, the student should divide the difference by the number of friends:\n\n8 (difference) / 5 (number of friends) = 1.6\n\nSince it is not possible for Matthew to give a fraction of a cracker to each friend, it's clear that the initial calculation was incorrect.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\n1. Determine the difference between the initial number of crackers and the number left: 31 - 23 = 8\n2. Divide the difference by the number of friends: 8 / 5 \u2248 1.6\n3. Recognize that the answer must be a whole number, so adjust the initial number of crackers to make the difference exactly divisible by 5 (the number of friends). For example, if Matthew had 35 crackers instead of 31, then the difference would be 15, which is divisible by 5, giving 3 crackers for each friend.\n\nBy pointing out these mistakes, you can help the student better understand the problem-solving process and improve their skills for future questions."

The problem states that there are 98 students in the school, and the school has 7 buses. The question asks \"if all buses are full, how many seats are in each bus?\"\n\nFrom this information, we can assume that there are enough seats on the buses for all 98 students. Therefore, if all 7 buses are full, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses to find the number of students per bus:\n\n98 students / 7 buses = 14 students per bus\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of seats in each bus, not the number of students. Since each bus is full, the number of seats in each bus must be equal to or greater than 14. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot determine the exact number of seats in each bus.\n\nTherefore, while your work is mostly correct, the answer of 30 seats per bus is not supported by the information provided in the question."

You know that they planted 12 seeds in each bed. So, you should divide the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds in each bed.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n1. Paige and her mom planted a total of 36 seeds.\n2. They planted 12 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. To find out how many flower beds they had, divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each bed: 36 seeds / 12 seeds per bed = 3 beds.\n\nTherefore, Paige and her mom had 3 flower beds."

To find the total number of marbles, we need to multiply the number of marbles each boy gets (which is 9) by the number of boys in the class (which is not given). However, even without the number of boys, we can still determine the correct answer.\n\nIf Haley gives 9 marbles to each boy, we can find out how many marbles she gave away in total by multiplying the number of marbles each boy receives by the number of boys.

Then, the equation would be:\n\nTotal marbles given = 9 \u00d7 x\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total number of marbles Haley had before giving any away. We know that the total number of marbles Haley had must be equal to the total marbles she gave away plus the marbles she has left. Since she hasn't given any marbles away yet, she has none left. Therefore, the total marbles she had must be equal to the total marbles she gave away.\n\nNow we know that the total marbles given is the same as the total marbles Haley had, and that the total marbles given is equal to 9 \u00d7 x. So, the total marbles Haley had must also be 9 \u00d7 x.\n\nSince the answer choices only provide a single value and not an expression like 9 \u00d7 x, we can infer that the number of marbles each boy received (9) is the same as the number of boys (x), meaning there are 9 boys in the class.\n\nIn this case, the total number of marbles Haley had would be:\n9 (marbles per boy) \u00d7 9 (boys) = 81\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided do not include 81.

To do this, you would subtract the number of games Kelly currently has from the target number of games. In this case, Kelly has 22 games and she wants to have 140 games in total. So, you would calculate 140 - 22 to find the number of games Kelly needs to buy.\n\nStudent's Answer: Kelly has 22 Nintendo games. To find out how many games she needs to buy to have 140\n\nIt looks like you've left out the calculation to find the number of games Kelly needs to buy. To get the correct answer, you should subtract 22 (the number of games Kelly currently has) from 140 (the target number of games). This will give you the number of games Kelly needs to buy to reach her goal.\n\nLet's try that calculation again:\n\n140 (target number of games) - 22 (number of games Kelly currently has) = 118\n\nSo, Kelly needs to buy 118 games to have 140 games in total."

To find out how many books Frank read, we can set up the following equation:\n\n772 = 492 + x\n\nWhere x is the number of books Frank read.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 492 - 772\n\nx = -280",

However, since Frank takes the same amount of time to finish each book, we should add the number of days it takes to finish one book by itself 66 times, rather than multiplying.\n\nFinally, the student set up the equation to find out how many books Frank read incorrectly. The equation should be 492 = 12x (where x is the number of books), rather than 772 = 492 + x.\n\nWhen we set up the equation correctly, we get:\n\n492 = 12x\n\nDividing both sides by 12, we get:\n\nx = 41\n\nTherefore, Frank read 41 books in 492 days."

So her weight after the first week should be:\n\n9 kg - 62 kg = -53 kg\n\nBut this answer doesn't make sense, since weights are typically positive numbers. The student has made a mistake in the way they have calculated the weight loss in the first week.\n\nSecond, in the calculation of the weight after the second week, the student has used the same incorrect calculation for weight loss in the first week.

Then, you stated that each Ferris wheel in paradise park has 19 seats. So, to find the total number of people one Ferris wheel can hold, we multiply the number of seats by the number of people per seat: 19 seats \u00d7 15 people/seat = 285 people/Ferris wheel.\n3. Finally, to find out how many people 20 Ferris wheels can hold at the same time, we multiply the number of Ferris wheels by the number of people one Ferris wheel can hold: 20 Ferris wheels \u00d7 285 people/Ferris wheel = 5700 people.\n\nIt seems that you made a mistake when calculating the number of people one Ferris wheel can hold.

Then, since the waiter still had 5 customers after some left, we can subtract the number of customers he had after they left (5) from the total number of customers (107), which gives us 102 customers who left. However, this number is greater than the initial number of customers, which doesn't make sense. This is because the question states that some customers left before the waiter got 99 new customers, so we should only count the number of customers who left after the waiter's initial 8 customers. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 (the initial number of customers) plus 99 (the number of new customers) minus 5 (the number of customers the waiter had after some left), which equals 102 minus 5, or 97 customers who left in total.

However, there's a small mistake in your calculation.\n\nTo find out how many packages Robin has, we need to divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each package. Here's how we can do it:\n\nTotal number of pieces of gum = Packages of gum \u00d7 Pieces per package + Extra pieces\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\n41 = Packages \u00d7 7 + 6\n\nTo find out how many packages Robin has, we need to solve for \"Packages.\" We can do this by first subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n35 = Packages \u00d7 7\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 7:\n\n5 = Packages\n\nSo, Robin has 5 packages of gum, not 4. Good job trying to solve the problem, and keep practicing!"

If Tiffany had 4 bags on Monday and then found 4 more bags the next day, that would mean she had 4 bags before finding the additional 4 bags. However, the problem does not specify how many bags Tiffany had on Monday, only that she had some number of bags and that this number plus the 4 bags she found the next day adds up to 8. Therefore, Tiffany must have had 8 - 4 = 4 fewer bags on Monday than she did the next day, so she must have had 8 - 4 = 4 bags on Monday."

Since the question asks for the number of children who got on the bus \"more\" than those who got off, you should find the difference between the two numbers: |x - 14|.
