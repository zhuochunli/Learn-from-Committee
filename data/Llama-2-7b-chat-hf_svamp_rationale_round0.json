Since she gave away an equal number of baseball cards and Ace cards, she gave away $250/2 = 125$ of each type of card.  Therefore, she now has $309 - 125 = 184$ baseball cards and $356 - 125 = 231$ Ace cards.  Thus, she has $184 - 231 = \\boxed{-47}$ more baseball cards than Ace cards.\nFinal Answer: $-47$",

            " The water was 24 feet deep.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so Dean's height is 14 feet - 8 feet = 6 feet.\n2. Then we learn that the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height, so the water depth is 2 * 6 feet = 12 feet.\n3. However, the question asks for the depth of the water after Ron stands in it, which means the water level rises another 8 feet due to Ron's height.\n4. Therefore, the final depth of the water when Ron stands in it is 12 feet (Dean's height) + 8 feet (Ron's height above Dean's) = 20 feet.\n5. But since the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height, we need to double this value to account for the full height of the water, which is 2 * 20 feet = 40 feet.\n6. However, the question states that the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height, not 2 times the combined height of Dean and Ron, so our answer of 40 feet is too high.\n7. Instead, we should have doubled the height of the water when Ron stands in it, which is 2 * 20 feet = 24 feet.\n\nTherefore, the water was 24 feet deep.",

This suggests that our assumption about Frank reading 3 pages per day was too high, and the actual number of pages per day should be lower.\n\nLet's try assuming that Frank read 2 pages per day instead:\n\nPages per chapter = Pages per day * Number of days\n                 = 2 pages/day * 220 days\n                 = 440 pages\n\nThis time, the result is less than the total number of pages in the book (555 pages). Therefore, we can conclude that the number of pages in each chapter is approximately 440 pages, with some remainder spread across the five chapters.\n\nSince the actual number of pages per day is likely between 2 and 3, and we know that the remainder must be divided among the five chapters, it's clear that each chapter has more than 440 pages but less than 555 pages.

They make $78 per t-shirt, so:\n\n14 (t-shirts sold during Texas tech game) x $78 (price per t-shirt) = $1092\n\nTherefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $1092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas tech game."

        "student_wrong_pred": "Answer: To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas tech game, we need to calculate the total amount of money made from the discounted t-shirts.\nFirst, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold at the regular price of $51 each. Since they sold 130 t-shirts, we can find the number of t-shirts sold at the regular price by dividing the number of t-shirts sold by the number of t-shirts sold at the discounted price:\nNumber of t-shirts sold at regular price = 130 t-shirts / 130 t-shirts sold at discounted price = 100 t-shirts\nNow, we can find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts at the regular price by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold at the regular price by the price of each t-shirt:\nMoney made from selling t-shirts at regular price = $51 x 100 t-shirts = $5,100\nNext, we need to find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts at the discounted price. Since they sold 130 t-shirts at a discount of $8 per t-shirt, we can find the amount of money made from selling t-shirts at the discounted price by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold at the discounted price by the amount of the discount:\nMoney made from selling t-shirts at discounted price = $8 x 130 t-shirts = $1,040",

However, the question seems to be logically inconsistent, as it asks for the number of trees that died more than those that survived, while what we actually calculated is the number of trees that died more than the number of trees that are still alive."

We can write:\n\nNell's cards after giving to Jeff = 252\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards Jeff had initially from the number of cards Nell had after giving some to Jeff:\n\nNumber of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 252 - 11 = 241",

Unfortunately, Emily does not have enough beads to make necklaces for all 72 of her friends. However, the question only asks how many necklaces Emily can make, so we'll calculate based on the information provided.\n8. With the initial 6 beads, Emily can make 2 necklaces.

            " Mary needs to add 22 more cups of flour.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The recipe calls for a 6:13 ratio of flour to sugar (in cups).\n2. Let's assume that Mary has added x cups of flour. Since she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can write this relationship as: x + 8 = 6.\n3. Solving for x, we get x = 6 - 8 = -2. However, since it's impossible to have a negative amount of flour, this means our assumption about the initial amount of flour was incorrect.\n4. Instead, let's assume that Mary has added y cups of flour so far. We now have the equation: y + 8 = 13 * n, where n is the required amount of sugar in terms of flour cups (y/n is the actual ratio of flour to sugar).\n5. Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, we know that 6 = 13 * m, where m is the required amount of sugar in terms of flour cups (6/13 is the actual ratio of flour to sugar).\n6. Comparing the two equations, we see that n = 2 and m = 6/13. Therefore, y + 8 = 13 * 2, which means y = 26 - 8 = 18 cups of flour.\n7. To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, subtract the current amount of flour from the total amount of flour required by the recipe: 6 - 18 = -12. However, this is not possible since she cannot have a negative amount of flour.\n8. This means that our assumption about the initial amount of flour was incorrect again. Instead, let's assume that Mary has added z cups of flour so far. We now have the equation: z + 22 = 13 * p, where p is the required amount of sugar in terms of flour cups (z/p is the actual ratio of flour to sugar).\n9. Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, we know that 6 = 13 * q, where q is the required amount of sugar in terms of flour cups (6/13 is the actual ratio of flour to sugar).\n10.

To find out how many books Frank read, we can set up the following equation:\n\n772 = 492 + x\n\nWhere x is the number of books Frank read.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 492 - 772\n\nx = -280",

            " Frank read 7 books.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's find out how many pages Frank reads in 12 days by using the information given about one book.\n2. In 12 days, Frank finishes 66 pages (one book).\n3. Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to finish 66 pages in general, not just when it's part of a single book.\n4. If 66 pages take 12 days, then 1 page takes 12/66 = 2/11 days.\n5. So, if we know that the total number of pages in all the books is X, we can calculate the time it takes Frank to read them all: (2/11) * X = 492 days.\n6. Solving for X, we get X = 492 * (11/2) = 2862 pages.\n7. Since each book has 66 pages, the number of books is 2862 / 66 \u2248 43.3. However, since the number of books must be a whole number, this means that there is some overlap in the time it took Frank to finish the last book with the initial setup of the question.\n8. Therefore, Frank actually read 7 books (6 complete books and a portion of the 7th book which was already included in the 492-day timeframe).",

Since he started with 58 bottle caps and 25 wrappers and now has 12 of each, he must have added:\n\n58 (initial bottle caps) - 12 (current bottle caps) = 46 bottle caps to his collection\n25 (initial wrappers) - 11 (current wrappers) = 14 wrappers to his collection\n\nNow, we can find out how many more bottle caps Danny has in his collection compared to wrappers:\n\n46 (current bottle caps) - 14 (current wrappers) = 32\n\nSo, Danny has 32 more bottle caps than wrappers in his collection."

We know that the total earnings for the ring toss game and the other game together in 30 days is 420 dollars + 22 dollars = 442 dollars.\n2. Let's assume that the other game made X dollars every day. Since the number of days remains the same (30 days), the ring toss game would also make the same amount of money each day, let's call it Y dollars.\n3. So, in 30 days, the other game would have made 30 * X dollars, and the ring toss game would have made 30 * Y dollars.\n4.

But we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the ring toss game made a whole number of dollars per day.\n6. If we try dividing 442 by 30, we get approximately 14.73 dollars.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money they made from selling 14 t-shirts at this price.\n\nTotal sales = Number of t-shirts sold * Price per t-shirt\n$7132 = 14 * $418 * $7132 = 14 * $5052\n\nTherefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $7132 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas tech game.",
